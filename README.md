This tutorial for beginners introduces foundational concepts and other building blocks for Python.

There are fun mini-projects and examples to aid learning.

We will be using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to execute Python code for the purpose of this tutorial. It is highly recommended to use Python 3 as Python 2 ~~will be sunset~~ has been sunset on January 1, 2020. Please follow these instructions as that will enable us to hit the ground running.
