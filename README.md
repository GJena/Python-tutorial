# Tutorial: Introduction to Programming with Python
Instructor: [Grishma Jena](https://gjena.github.io)

This tutorial for beginners introduces foundational concepts and other building blocks for Python. Learn about syntax, I/O, control flow, data structures along with functions, classes, iterators and generators and finally, applications of Python. There are fun mini-projects and examples to aid learning.

We will be using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to execute Python code for the purpose of this tutorial. It is highly recommended to use Python 3 as Python 2 ~~will be sunset~~ has been sunset on January 1, 2020. Please follow these instructions as that will enable us to hit the ground running.

__Objectives__
By the end of this workshop, attendees will gain command over foundational and some intermediate concepts. They will be able to use Python and leverage data structures and functions to perform various tasks. This session serves as a good starting point for attendees to delve deeper into the world of programming and Computer Science.
